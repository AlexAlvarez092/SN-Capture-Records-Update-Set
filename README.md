My own version of the well-known "Cature record in update set" feature.

Features included:

- Toggle on/off property allowing to disable the feature in the production environment.
- Commit/discard changes made in the record before being captured in the update set.
- Capture multiple records from the list view at a time.
- Include/exclude tables extending sys_metadata. Most of them are yet captured by default.

# Installation

- Option 1. Cloning repository
- Option 2. Committing [update set](./releases/capture_update_set_100.xml)
